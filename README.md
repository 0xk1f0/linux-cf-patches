# Cloudflare Linux Kernel Patches

This repository contains some Linux Kernel patches, which where not submitted to the mainline kernel tree. These patches may be not generic enough for inclusion into the mainline kernel tree, declined by the kernel maintainers etc.

## Supported Kernel Versions

Normally the patches in this repository should be applicable on top of the latest [Linux Kernel long-term support ("LTS") release](https://www.kernel.org/releases.html).  Other versions are not considered.

These patches are provided as-is without any support guarantee, but contributions are welcome.
